# Stock-Analysis

Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of this project was to compare the years 2017 and 2018 stock rate  returns. We were trying to see what stocks were loosing money or gaining money within the two years and what that reasoning was.


Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

I could not get the images to work but based off of the spreadsheet data I could see that for most stocks the following year, 2018 they all opened at a higher price. When looking at the image within the modudle I can see that the rate of return was negative with stocks that had less daily volume, which were most. The stocks that had a higher rate or positive rate had a higher volume, meaning more traffic/buy in.


Summary: 

What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

The disadvatnages are  not knowing if you are doing something wrong and where the error or what the error is.  The adavatnages are being able to ask a different question or looking at a different set of data by changing a line or the values/indexs. It makes looking at a bunch of individul data to find a pattern easy.

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

The cons are like I mentioned getting an error that you need to debug and you cannot locate where the error was . The pros to refactoring it was that the majority of it was completed so we just needed to put in our values for what we were looking for this project.
